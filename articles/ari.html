    <p> Ariana Grande has a new single out: Thank you, next. This song is more along the lines of her most recent album, sweetener, then her freshmen albums. However, this song is incredibly powerful. She addresses everything and every relationship she has had in the public eye. Sort of a Taylor Swift move for Grande but her approach to singing about ex’s is nothing like Swifts’. The first time I listened to it I cried and I’ve continued to tear up every time I hear her reference Mac Miller in the line, “wish I could say thank you to Malcolm cause he was an angel.” This 25-year-old powerhouse has gone through immense tragedy in the public eye and I can’t even think about how she is managing. But then she slips out passing the tabloid rumors by and releases this song that has absolutely no hate or negative message. She somehow is able to create art that is positive for her and for the world despite what events have happened to her. This song empowers me to move on from my bad habits and old comforts and become a healthier me, taking with me all that I have learned from my past.</br>

When Mac Miller died on September 7th I read it out loud from my twitter news page. I didn’t realize what I was really saying and I immediately thought no that didn’t say “found dead” he maybe OD’ed but he’s not actually dead. But then I kept reading and was absolutely heartbroken. Mac Millers’ music was my high school years and I will never not be thankful for his music. It clearly brings to life those years and I don’t think it would have been the same without it. I saw him in concert in Oakland and it was actually the first picture I posted on my Instagram, in 2011. I can’t believe Miller died at such a young age and I think it will always impact me because I think of how some of my childhood friends have passed too young and Miller kind of feels like a childhood friend. Either way I understand how his close friends and family feel but to extrapolate that on a worldwide scale and have so many more people who loved and appreciated him I just can’t imagine it.
</br>
I’m in no way surprised that Grande had to end her engagement with Pete Davidson, if anything I can’t believe it didn’t happen earlier. I would have crumbled the second I heard the news and lost all the feelings I had for this guy I’d only be dating for a couple of months. Her relationship with Malcolm was years long and they clearly loved each other. He was there for her when a terrorist set off a bomb at her concert that killed 19 fans. And she was there for him through drug use. I ‘m so sorry that this had to happen to her and to him and I don’t understand why. But if anything it’s another reminder that this world is unfair and to cherish every moment we have with the people we love.
