What can I say about the Beatles that hasn't already been said? With that in mind
I will just impart what I can as a millenial admirer of the iconic band known around the world.
I have always known the Beatles music innately. It is just that band that has various musical styles that have been played through many platforms. I sang When I’m 64 and Yellow Submarine in my elementary school choir class; Here Comes the Sun was in every movie growing up in the late 90’s/early 2000’s; Imagine has been played during any photo slideshow I have ever viewed and Drive my Car amplifies any driving commercial. These songs are second nature to many but are not exactly the reason you continue to invest in their music. I find that I have no close friends that know anything about the Beatles besides the songs listed above. It seems baffling since this band is known to people all throughout the world. However, I continue to buy Beatles vinyl whenever I come across a record store and cry to the beautiful songs without them.
Every time I listen to their music I hear something new or feel something different. They have the ability to make you feel very specific emotions and evoke a sense of place in each song. I would have to say that their music sounds dated now in respect to the kind of music that is among the top charts. Now, some would agree and continue to listen to modern music but there is something so much more authentic in their music that can grab you and make you feel like this song is meant only for you. Some music today is so incredibly overproduced and tuned that to hear some of the tracks, on say Rubber Soul, would understandably deter people from listening. They want the perfection. Not to say that the Beatles were not perfect or perfectionists but more that the realness of their music came through even after production.
For myself, to talk about the Beatles is to talk for ever and ever. And well much has been said before. But simply, The Beatles totally rule and will never not be the greatest band ever.
