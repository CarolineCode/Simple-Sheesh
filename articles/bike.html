<h1> Get Pumped</h1> <h3>SNC Students Stoked for New Bike Park </h3>
<h6> By Caroline Coughlin </h6>

  <p>Incline bikers rejoice! There is a new pump track in town, the Incline Bike Park is located next to the IVGID Rec Center and has been open for your riding pleasure, since Oct. 28th. It was created for all skill levels and all ages and features lines for beginners to advanced.

<p>For those unfamiliar with the definition of a pump track, Incline Bike Project creator, Aaron James, a.k.a. Elko explains, “a pump track is a bike track with rollers and features for riders to learn how to control their bike. There are berms, elevated turns, to teach you how to have balance without having to pedal or brake.” Riding at this park is done by either sitting or standing on small bikes which can “teach you the exact feeling of learning to control and balance your bicycle in differing terrain,” Elko said.

<p>The mountain biking community in Tahoe is huge. The draw for tourists to travel here to bike, rivals the ski and snowboarding communities. Since Incline Village didn’t have their own bike park the local residents used to drive to South Lake or Truckee to ride, causing those parks to be overly congested. Elko knew that the need for our own community park was strong and began putting the park into the works, four years ago. During those years, Incline Bike project became a non-profit and partnered with Incline Tahoe Foundation, which is the organization that sets up the recreational opportunities for IVGID. After a few fundraisers with Alibi Ale works, the Nugget casino in Reno and very generous donations from fellow community members, the Incline Bike project was off and running. “We worked for a month straight with only one day to knock it out and opened on the 28th,” Elko said.

 <p>Our student community could not be more excited for this local riding opportunity. “Having the pump track added to the town and so close to campus has been a great addition,” sophomore Jonas Patten said. “Before moving to Tahoe I was not that into mountain biking but I knew there would be an opportunity to get better here and all the people I’ve met at the pump track are so happy to have it. We can’t wait until next year when they will add another line to the park,” Patten Said.

<p>SNC senior Chase Rudy visited the park in its opening week, “they have three different runs that get progressively harder. I mountain bike for fun but even some of the stuff they have there, I can’t do. Although, the park is huge my friends and I can’t for it all to be finished.”

<p>Currently, there is only one jump considered advanced at the park but they will begin creating an advanced line “with jumps and everything,” next spring. Also, for students looking for a seasonal job, next summer IVGID will be hiring a full time employee position to maintain the park.

<p>This park could not have opened without the help of many community members. “Hats off to Incline Tahoe Foundation, IVGID engineering and TRPA, they’ve been on our sides the whole entire way and have been really supportive. Also huge thanks to the Hollmans, whose generosity is what really made this dream a reality,” Elko said.

<p>The Incline Bike park is open from dusk until dawn for bikers only, no skateboards or scooters are permitted due to the clay surface of the track.
