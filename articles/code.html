    <p> This website was manifested from the frustration I felt after experiencing the template based website builders SqaureSpace, WordPress and Format. These companies promise you an easy to create website using the premade themes either free or purchasable. Even if you sign up for the most expensive option that states you can add your own CSS, you cannot alter these premade themes to your interests. More and more people are using these sites to build their companies websites to become competitive in their market. The problem that occurs when companies use these site are numerous. To start off, all websites look the same now, it is a phenomenon that many people have noticed and questioned. Part of the reason for this is because of these template web builder sites. They are not capable to rearrange to your liking and then you are stuck with the same looking website as thousands of other people and businesses. I understand the pull at which these template sites draw people in because I too have used them. However, I never liked my finished site, it never felt like it was truly my own or that it got across the message or feeling I wanted to evoke. Then I decided I could learn how to code for myself, and boom this website was born… Well not exactly, after months and months of research, taking classes and filling notebooks with tips on coding I have a usable static website. This endeavor has not been easy and I have fallen victim to breaking down and crying at the difficulty that creating a website brings. However, I now have a completely unique website that no one else has and I can proudly say that I built it all myself. Learning to code this website will not only be good for this single project, but it is a skill that is in-demand in our economy today. Almost every company in the world has a website, or uses computer code in some way. I have just taught myself a skill that is needed around the world. I encourage anyone who is interested in learning about coding to go out and learn it. You won’t regret this decision and you will always have a leg up on your competition with this skill.
