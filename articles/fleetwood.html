  <p>My all-time favorite band is Fleetwood Mac. Every time I hear
    their music I get a certain feeling. One that I can’t necessarily
    define right away, but I would say it’s a mixture of comfort,
    inspiration and happiness. You have to move to their music, even
    if you’re just swaying. This band means so much to me. I have always
    listened to music from the sixties and seventies growing up, but my
    parents were not huge fans of Fleetwood. They know the hit songs and
     some things about them but it wasn’t enough for me to know as a kid.
      I found them when I was in middle school thanks to my best friends’
       dad when he played <font color="#FF2B98"> Dreams.</font> I put it on repeat and we just danced and
        sang. I instantly needed more from this band. Since then, I have
         always had them on my playlists and I continue to find new songs
          and develop new favorites. They even have a song called <font color="#FF2B98"> Caroline </font>
           from their Tango in the Night album. A few of their songs you can never go wrong with
         include:</br><font color="#FF2B98"> Sara, Never Going Back Again, Landslide, Gold Dust Women, Tusk, Everywhere,
            You Make Loving Fun, Little Lies, Seven Wonders, Don’t Stop, Song Bird, Second Hand News, I Don’t Want to Know, Big Love, Rhiannon,
            Say That You Love Me, Sisters of the Moon, Tusk, World Turning, Black Magic Woman, Over My Head,
          </font>& <font color="#FF2B98"> Go Your Own Way</font>

<p> All of these songs have a special place in my heart for evoking different
    feelings. The first is one that resonated with how I was feeling at a
      certain time in high school. </br><font color="#FF2B98"> “Silver Springs”</font> is a ballad that touches
      on unrequited love and friendship. (It’s one of their swaying songs)
      This song has made me cry on multiple occasions, it is definitely sad
     and about breaking up from this relationship. But I feel like this
    five-minute-long song can take you through different stages of emotion
     and you can come out of the other end feeling like you worked through something.
      One reason I think this song is so impactful is because its raw. Stevie wrote this
       about her bandmate Lindsey Buckingham, the two who have famously dated and broken
        up and continued to be in Fleetwood Mac together.</br>
        <font color="#25CBD1"> Favorite Lyrics</font>: <i>“so I begin not to love you, turn around and see me running. I say I loved
      you years ago, but tell myself you never loved me, no”</i> as well as <i>“time cast a spell on you,
       but you won’t forget me. I know I could’ve loved you but you would not let me. I follow you
        down until the sound of my voice will haunt you. You’ll never get away from the sound of the
         woman that love you.”</i>

<p>Listening to <font color="#FF2B98">Gypsy</font>, you feel like a gypsy. It is such a fun song and I have done many interpretive
 dances to this one. I see this song as thinking about a different version of yourself and saying
  that that person is still within you now. It is reflective and makes you think about being free
   and just spinning around. The ending of this song is my favorite, there is a long guitar riff
   that repeats its melodic notes and it makes you want to spin. I wish this part of the song would
 never end I always, always hear it and have to replay the song so I can hear it again.</br>
<font color="#25CBD1">Favorite Lyrics</font>: <i>“I have no fear, I have only love"</i>

 <p><font color="#FF2B98"> Leather and Lace,</font> this song is my mother’s favorite. Technically it is Stevie Nicks song with Don
  Henley of the Eagles but I’m including it regardless. This song is powerful yet sweet, it says that
  it is okay to be soft and it is okay to need your partner. It is the most beautiful love song because
  it is not just about loving someone a lot but it is actually about how this person is making you a better person.
  Stevie sang this song live with <a href="../articles/harryarticle.html"> Harry Styles </a> in 2017 and it is a beautiful rendition
  but nothing can top the original.
</br><font color="#25CBD1">Favorite lyrics:</font> <i>“Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow, shatter with words, impossible to follow. You’re saying
I’m fragile, I try not to be I search only for something I can’t see. I have my own life and I am stronger than you
know. But I carry this feeling when you walked into my house that you won’t be walking out the door.” “Sometime I’m a
 strong man, sometimes cold and scared and sometimes I cry. But that time I saw you I knew with you to light my nights
 and somehow I could get by.”</i>

   <p><font color="#FF2B98"> The Chain </font> is a classic Fleetwood rock song. It has hints of bluegrass twang mixed with ethereal mystery that so
      explain this band for me. This song starts out howling about the wind and leads to a full throttle rock out jam
       with all bandmates playing loud and powerfully. It is so hard to reach the end of the song and not thrash about.
        When this song was written, all the band members were facing relationships at their breaking point. You can feel
         the questioning of their lovers allegiance in this song.
</br><font color="#25CBD1">Favorite lyrics:</font> <i>“Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies.” “And if you don’t love me now, you will never
 love me again. I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain.”</i>

   <p> <font color="#ff2b98">Bleed To Love Her</font> is a song that I have just discovered. It came on when I shuffled music by Fleetwood on my Alexa device. From the first note I was hooked, yet another song by this band has grabbed my attention and held it. The song itself is very simple. It has a reoccurring rhythm and Lindsey Buckingham’s vocals at the lead. The song is comfortable and feels nostalgic and melancholy. The lyrics are quite sad explaining a relationship where the person has more love for their partner than they do. I can listen to this for hours and I still haven’t decided whether I prefer the studio or the live version better.
</br><font color="#25CBD1"> Favorite Lyrics:</font> <i>“Once again she steals away, then she reaches out to kiss me. And how she takes my breath away, pretending that she don’t miss me”</i>
