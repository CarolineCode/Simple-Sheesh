    <p> I'm living for Harry Styles, he put out a solo album last May, and if you haven't given
      it a chance because he rose to fame with boyband One Direction, you're missing out BIG TIME.
       His songs are reminiscent of Bowie, Elton John and Fleetwood Mac (he is even friends with Stevie
       Nicks and Mick Fleetwood). His lyrics are honest and catchy and his voice is broad, deep and full
        of sensual emotion, perfect for singing along with in your car. If you like, Blackbird by the
        Beatles, you should listen to <font color="#FF2B98"> Sweet Creature</font> by Harry Styles. Other songs on his album including
<font color="#FF2B98"> Carolina, Kiwi, Only Angel</font> and <font color="#FF2B98"> Sign of the Times </font> are heavily influenced by rock elements. Kiwi
          is a fast paced rocker that gets you blood pumpin and feet moving. Sign of the Times is an
           insane song. It was the first single that Styles put out after leaving the band and it is
           like nothing you can even expect. The song emotes pain, love, nostalgia and all culminates
           at the end when the music builds to its peak and ends leaving you exhausted.<font color="#FF2B98"> From the Dining
            Table</font> is the last song on the album and is hard to explain, but I will try. It feels as if
             Styles is in the room with you whispering the lyrics. He has a way to make you feel the
             emotions he experienced while writing these songs and it’s a journey from start to finish.
              This album is worth the listen and clocks in at only 10 songs, so you won’t waste a day
               if you don’t end up liking it, but I assure that you will. </p>
