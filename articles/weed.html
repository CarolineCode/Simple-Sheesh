<h1> Marijuana is legal ...</h1> <h2> but not on campus </h2>
<h6> By Caroline Coughlin </h6>

  <p>
  Marijuana. Cannabis. Weed. Whatever your word for the infamous plant, it is finally legal to recreationally purchase it in Incline Village.  Of course, with some stipulations, including being 21 years or older to purchase, no smoking of the recreational marijuana in public places and an 18.2% tax on your recreational items (versus 8.2% for medical).

<p>Despite the tax, the local dispensary, NuLeaf has become highly frequented by all walks of life, including students. “We don’t have many people mention where they came from but a good amount of the 20-30 age group demographic do say they go to a nearby college,” NuLeaf store manager, Lindsey Anderson said. “We see a ton of locals daily but the majority of our clientele are tourists,” Anderson said.

<p>Since, recreational sales have only been going since July 1, 2017, does that mean students can have weed at SNC? No, not quite, because our college receives federal funding our campus must follow the federal rule. “Even though it is legal in your home for 21 and up, it isn’t allowed on campus,” Lizzie Thibodeau, Director of Student Affairs said.

<p>Senior Sarah Jakel said, “I don’t think it’ll impact the students much because it’s still not allowed on campus or let alone in any public setting, Plus, you have to be 21 to go into any dispensary and there’s so many restrictions on how much you can purchase and when and where, you can smoke legally.”

<p>The Tahoe culture has long coincided with marijuana use, perhaps due to the feel good vibes of the alpine atmosphere. With the sales of recreational marijuana producing 3 million dollars within the first four days, the tax revenue for Nevada is proving to be extremely promising.

<p>“We find the tax fair, as registered patients do not have to pay the excised tax, only the sales tax will be added at point of sale, and recreational users do pay the excised tax. This tax money benefits the state by providing funding to schools and the VA. We are already seeing some major outcomes in school funding” Anderson said.

<p>Some parents and citizens were speaking out about their concern that our state would become full of a bunch of lazy, stoners. The stereotypical traits of people who use marijuana are often wrongly projected onto the users. “I think weed becoming recreationally legal is a pretty good thing because legalizing it doesn’t mean there is going to be an increase in use, now you can more so control legal substances better than you can illegal ones,” Jakel said. “Marijuana also has so many health benefits and I think that it becoming recreationally legal will get people to start understanding and supporting it rather than supporting corrupt pharmaceutical companies.”

<p>The journey that marijuana has gone through to become legalized has been long and hard fought. Marijuana was first banned in Nevada in 1923 and it wasn’t until 1998 when medical marijuana was passed in an election. 94 years later the schedule 1 drug is back thanks to public pressure and now we are free to inhale the good and exhale the bad, in the privacy of our homes of course.
